# laravel-8-class
This repository contains the code, notes, and examples I created while attending the "Mastering Laravel 8 Framework" class taught by Ahmad Hakim on CodePolitan. The class covered essential topics for beginners, including Laravel installation, routing, controllers, Blade templating, CRUD operations, input validation, middleware, and authentication.
